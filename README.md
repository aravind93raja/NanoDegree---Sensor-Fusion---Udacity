# NanoDegree Program on SENSOR FUSION 

## Collection of Projects part of the above mentioned program by Udacity

### 1) Project - Lidar Obstacle Detection

Filter, segment, and cluster real point cloud data to detect
obstacles in a driving environment.

### 2) Project - 2D Feature Tracking

Detect features from objects in a camera image using
state-of-the-art detectors and standard methods
Match features between images to track objects over
time using state-of-the-art binary descriptors

### 3) Project - 3D Object Tracking

Detect and track objects in 3D space from the benchmark KITTI
dataset based on camera and lidar measurements. Compute
time-to-collision based on both sensors and compare the results.
Identify the best combination of keypoint detectors
and descriptors for object tracking.

### 4) Project - Radar Processing

Calibrate, threshold, and filter radar data to detect obstacles in real
radar data.

### 5) Project - Multiple Object Tracking

Coding an Unscented Kalman Filter in C++
in order to track highly non-linear pedestrian and bicycle motion
